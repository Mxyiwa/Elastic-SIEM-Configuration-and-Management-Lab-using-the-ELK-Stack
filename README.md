# Elastic Stack SIEM Configuration and Management Lab

## Objective

The objective of building an Elastic SIEM lab is to set up a home lab environment using Elastic SIEM within a Kali Linux VM, where data is forwarded from the VM to the SIEM through the Elastic Defend agent. In this lab, security events are generated on the Kali Linux VM using Nmap, and these logs are then queried and analyzed within the Elastic web interface. To enhance visibility and monitoring, a dashboard is created to visualize the security events, accompanied by an alert system to notify when specific security events are detected.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of Elastic SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in querying, analysing, and interpreting security event logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Parallels VM
- Kali Linux
- Elastic SIEM
- Elastic Defend Agent
