# HOW TO BUILD AN ELASTIC SIEM LAB

## Objective

The objective of building an Elastic SIEM lab is to set up a home lab environment using Elastic SIEM within a Kali Linux VM, where data is forwarded from the VM to the SIEM through the Elastic Defend agent. In this lab, security events are generated on the Kali Linux VM using Nmap, and these logs are then queried and analyzed within the Elastic web interface. To enhance visibility and monitoring, a dashboard is created to visualize the security events, accompanied by an alert system to notify when specific security events are detected.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
